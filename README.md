Every time someone wins/looses, some parameters of the game change. The parameters that currently change are:
```
COURT_HEIGHT
COURT_WIDTH
BALL_SIZE
BALL_SPEED
PAD_LENGTH
PAD_SPEED
GRAVITY_X
GRAVITY_Y
```

I just did this as a fun hour-long game jam, and am unlikely to make further changes. However it someone wants to make PR's, I'll happily review/approve/give-moderator-permissions. I don't think it would take too much to make this into a pretty fun little game.
